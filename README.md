# Pollen_germination_detection
The Mask R-CNN model of the paper "Deep learning-based high-throughput detection of in vitro germination to assess pollen viability from microscopic images"

1.Before running demo.py, please download the weight of the proposed Mask R-CNN via the link below and place it in the "dnn_model" folder.
